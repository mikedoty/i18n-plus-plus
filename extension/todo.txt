// wire up translate button

// translate should only be primary if no translation exists

// ^ or if translation === en.json + "*" (e.g. "Add*")

// ^ otherwise it's secodnary and called "Re-translate"

support singular|plural translation with 2-col layout

// add "save to file" option for each after change
   ^ this goes through node server

// allow manual tweaking after translation arrives

// ability to add new translation in left panel

// search filter in left panel by key or english text

// option to prefer elevate folders to the top in left panel

// save prefs in extension state (e.g. elevate folders pref)

// add filter for "only new translations" that checks against development en.json

// ^ (probably requires having either manually en.json added or used left panel add already!)

// left panel filters etc. are "stickY" - use flex column for below content

// after clicking blue "translate" and saving changes, "translate" should now be grey and re-translate

// save api key in state
